## ECAT 2.0 forms the base version, as defined by Dries Vermont from IniTeam.

Product management in furniture retail is quite often a big challenge. They have a lot of suppliers, with sometimes complex product structures. The shops want more and more to have all of the product information in their software (eMeubel in our case). So they can inform and serve their clients in a contemporary manner (in shop and on the web). And also all of their employees then have access to the product information.
For the exchange of simple, flat products, you can use Excel (CSV). For more complex products, this is not so straightforward. This is why we, for eMeubel, have defined an XML format, that can handle such complex structure.
A supplier that generates this XML out of there ERP, can send this file directly to the shops. The shop can import this file and obtain all the correct product information. The communication between supplier and vendor is directly, there is no EDI vendor in between.
