# Arxis ECAT Standard and Developments

This document is to service all Retail Software Systems connected to the Arxis Ecosystem. Arxis guarantees fileformat build up according to the ECAT 2.0 standard, extended with the below mentioned additions.
We allow room for each individual Retail Software System to develop on top of these standard and we will add these to their own formats, yet guarantee the ability to download in the format as supported by each Retail Software Systems.
As soon as all Eco-system members fully agree and fully support an updated ECAT version, this will override the previous version.
