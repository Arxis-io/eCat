ECAT 2.0 forms the base version, as defined by Dries Vermont from IniTeam.

Product management in furniture retail is quite often a big challenge. They have a lot of suppliers, with sometimes complex product structures. The shops want more and more to have all of the product information in their software (eMeubel in our case). So they can inform and serve their clients in a contemporary manner (in shop and on the web). And also all of their employees then have access to the product information.
For the exchange of simple, flat products, you can use Excel (CSV). For more complex products, this is not so straightforward. This is why we, for eMeubel, have defined an XML format, that can handle such complex structure.
A supplier that generates this XML out of there ERP, can send this file directly to the shops. The shop can import this file and obtain all the correct product information. The communication between supplier and vendor is directly, there is no EDI vendor in between.

For suppliers who are not in the possibility of building and exporting the XML from there ERP, we have 2 solutions:
-	We make a conversion/integration tool based on the available data
-	The supplier can input and manage the catalog manually in ‘eCat’, our software tool for building catalogues. (Retailers are also using this tool for building and maintaining catalogues  of suppliers that don’t provide digital catalogues)
Also if the supplier wants to check their catalog before sending it to the shop, or if they want to add something (eg multimedia), this can be done via eCat.

The retailer can send his purchase orders via e-mail or FTP to the supplier. The e-mail has 2 attachments: the order as a pdf and in XML format. The supplier can import this XML order in their ERP. (if this option is provided by the ERP of course.)

In the document that is attached, we explain how the eCatXML catalogue is built.
